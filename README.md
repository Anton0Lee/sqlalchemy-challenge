# sqlalchemy-challenge  
Data Analytics Bootcamp Challenge 10  
This repo includes a app.py file which creates an API to look through the analysis from the climate_starter.ipynb, plus a few additional queries.  
The climate_starter.ipynb includes an analysis of the sqlite from the Resoures folder.  
The Resources folder includes a sqlite file, and 2 csv file, which are provided to start off.  
--------------------------------------
When working in the .ipynb, the most difficult part for this challenge would be getting the correct date for the query as I was not familiar with what datetime funciton can be done.  
It was also difficult to plot the graph so that it would match the requested look as I was not familiar to the setting available.  
As for the .py, I found difficult trying to workout what went wrong with my codes as there is no indicator of which part of the codes is incorrect.  
Most of the time, i found myself using the .ipynb for testing to see if the code is correct.
